# MusiK ðŸŽµ

MusiK is a React Native music player application that allows users to play, pause, shuffle, and control music tracks with ease. The app is built using `react-native-track-player` for seamless audio playback and provides a rich user experience with robust audio playback capabilities, supporting a range of user interactions and custom controls.

## Features

- **Floating Player**: Integrates a dynamic floating player that displays the current track's album art, title, and artist name. Users can control playback directly from this interface, with buttons for play/pause, skipping to the next track, and returning to the previous track.
- **Shuffle Functionality**: Enables users to shuffle the current playlist with a single tap.
- **Seek Slider**: A precise and responsive seek slider that allows users to scrub through the track. The slider updates in real-time, reflecting the current playback position and enabling users to easily navigate through a song.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations for an optimal user experience.
